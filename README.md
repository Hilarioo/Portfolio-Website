# Mobile First | Responsive Portfolio Website

[https://hilario.io](https://hilario.io)

Responsive portfolio website created with HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

I created the website with a Mobile-First Approach since more people surf the web on their mobile devices than on desktops. The website dynamically changes, allowing the design and content to resize accordingly.

### Mobile Demo of Website

I used [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host my website and handle spam for my form submissions.

### Feedback

I love feedback! Please let me know your thoughts and if there is anything I should change or incorporate. Also, this is v1.0 - I'm planning on incorporating ReactJS and other libraries soon.
